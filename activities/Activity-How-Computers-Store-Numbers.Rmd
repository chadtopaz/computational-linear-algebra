# Problem 3

By hand, calculate the IEEE double precision representation fl(1/3) and find the relative error in the computer storage of this number.

# Problem 4

Consider the function

$$
f(x)=\frac{1-(1-x)^3}{x}
$$

for x = $10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, \ldots, 10^{-14}$. Then use an alternative form of the expression that doesn't suffer from subtracting nearly equal numbers. Consider the results from the second calculation to be exact, and make a log-log plot of the relative error in the first calculation as a function of x. What is the general trend?

# Problem 5

Consider a right triangle whose legs are of length 3344556600 and 1.2222222. How much longer is the hypotenuse than the longer leg?
