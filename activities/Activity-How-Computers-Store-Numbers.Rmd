***

When you begin work during class, work with your assigned partner. Please have only one electronic device open and work on it jointly. When writing up this assignment, please remember that showing all of your work and giving your reasoning are critical parts of achieving mastery. If the course staff cannot tell how you solved a problem or finds leaps in explanation or logic, the problem is not mastered. Finally, as a matter of academic integrity, please make sure that you are positioned to honestly answer yes to these questions:

- Have I disclosed everyone with whom I collaborated on this work? (Even if it is only my assigned partner.)

- Have I made a substantive intellectual contribution to the solution of every problem?

- Am I in any way passing off as my own work any work that belongs to someone else?

Whether intentional or unintentional, any potential violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Honor Committee.

# Problem 2

Convert the base 10 number 1/3 to binary.

# Problem 2 Solution

Your solution goes here.

# Problem 3

By hand, calculate the IEEE double precision representation fl(1/3) and find the relative error in the computer storage of this number.

# Problem 3 Solution

Your solution goes here.

# Problem 4

Consider the function

$$
f(x)=\frac{1-(1-x)^3}{x}
$$

for x = $10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, \ldots, 10^{-14}$. Then use an alternative form of the expression that doesn't suffer from subtracting nearly equal numbers. Consider the results from the second calculation to be exact, and make a log-log plot of the relative error in the first calculation as a function of x. What is the general trend?

# Problem 4 Solution

# Problem 5

Consider a right triangle whose legs are of length 3344556600 and 1.2222222. How much longer is the hypotenuse than the longer leg?
