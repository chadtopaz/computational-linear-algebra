## Introduction

I am [Prof. Chad Topaz](http://www.chadtopaz.com). Welcome to the public-facing version of  my Computational Linear Algebra course. This course is a minimalist recreation of the one I use on my own campus at Williams College. You can access most of the basic course materials here. Since this site is for public sharing, I have eliminated certain items related to surveying my students, performing course evaluation, student assessment, and so forth. I enthusiastically credit colleagues from my time at Macalester College: Tom Halverson, Danny Kaplan, David Shuman, and Lori Ziegelmeier. Their versions of a Computational Linear Algebra course have influenced my own course, and I'm grateful to them for sharing wisdom and materials.

## Citation

If you use this site as a student (for your own learning ) or as an instructor (for teaching your own course) I would appreciate you [letting me know](mailto:chad.topaz+impact@gmail.com) so that I can track impact of the work I have done to create it. If you do adopt materials from this site, please make sure to credit me.

## In Development

This course site is perpetually in development. I regularly revisit my course materials in order to improve them.

## Errata

If you find any problems with course materials (a typo, code that doesn't work, a broken link – anything at all) please let me know by [contacting me here](mailto:chad.topaz+errata@gmail.com).

## Consulting/Speaking

I have built this public-facing site as a free, shareable public good. If you are interested in assistance with technical/mathematical aspects of this course or related consulting, please [contact me here](mailto:chad.topaz+consulting@gmail.com). If you would like me to speak to your department/institution/organization about curriculum and/or pedagogy (of this course, or of anything else) then please see my [Speaking](http://www.chadtopaz.com/speaking) page and contact me [here](mailto:chad.topaz+speaking@gmail.com).

## Course Syllabus

Rather than using a traditional text-based course syllabus, I use a rather concise graphical syllabus; see below. I designed this syllabus using Piktochart. A similar tool you could consider is Canva. Some details of this syllabus are not relevant for a broad public audience, but I include the full syllabus nonetheless in order to give a flavor of the course and the philosophy I bring to it.

## R Resources

This course uses the R programming language in the RStudio integrated development environment. RStudio Cloud is a free version of RStudio that you can run on any device that has an internet connection and a web browser.

## Course Details

Each link below leads to a course unit page. A few characteristics of my on-the-ground course include:

* Ungrading
* Flipped classroom style, including pre-class quizzes
* An introductory half-week that gets students oriented to the course
* Organization around weekly blocks of material
* Substantial in-class small-group discussion

To enable you to make easy and flexible use of the resources here, I have eliminated these elements from this public-facing version of the course. Essentially, what I am providing here is a core dump of materials I use.

The course units are below.
