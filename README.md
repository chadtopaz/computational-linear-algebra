# Course Information

## Introduction

I am [Prof. Chad Topaz](http://www.chadtopaz.com). Welcome to the public
facing version of my Computational Linear Algebra course. This course is
a minimalist recreation of the one I use on my own campus at Williams
College. You can access most of the basic course materials here. Since
this site is for public sharing, I have eliminated certain items related
to surveying my students, performing course evaluation, student
assessment, and so forth. I enthusiastically credit colleagues from my
time at Macalester College: Tom Halverson, Danny Kaplan, David Shuman,
and Lori Ziegelmeier. Their versions of a Computational Linear Algebra
course have influenced my own course, and I’m grateful to them for
sharing wisdom and materials.

## Citation

If you use this site as a student (for your own learning) or as an
instructor (for teaching your own course) I would appreciate you
[letting me know](mailto:chad.topaz+impact@gmail.com) so that I can
track impact of the work I have done to create it. If you do adopt
materials from this site, please make sure to credit me.

## In Development

This course site is perpetually in development. I regularly revisit my
course materials in order to improve them.

## Errata

If you find any problems with course materials (a typo, code that
doesn’t work, a broken link – anything at all) please let me know by
[contacting me here](mailto:chad.topaz+errata@gmail.com).

## Consulting/Speaking

I have built this public facing site as a free, shareable public good.
If you are interested in assistance with technical/mathematical aspects
of this course or related consulting, please [contact me
here](mailto:chad.topaz+consulting@gmail.com). If you would like me to
speak to your department/institution/organization about curriculum
and/or pedagogy (of this course, or of anything else) then please see my
[Speaking](http://www.chadtopaz.com/speaking) page and contact me
[here](mailto:chad.topaz+speaking@gmail.com).

## Course Syllabus

Rather than using a traditional text-based course syllabus, I use a
rather concise graphical syllabus; see below. I designed this syllabus
using Piktochart. A similar tool you could consider is Canva. Some
details of this syllabus are not relevant for a broad public audience,
but I include the full syllabus nonetheless in order to give a flavor of
the course and the philosophy I bring to it.

## R Resources

This course uses the R programming language in the RStudio integrated
development environment. [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) is a
free version of RStudio that you can run on any device that has an
internet connection and a web browser.

Here are some help resources for R.

## Course Details

A few characteristics of my on-the-ground course include:

-   Ungrading
-   Flipped classroom style, including pre-class quizzes
-   Introductory activities that get students oriented to the course
-   Organization around weekly blocks of material
-   Substantial in-class small-group discussion

To enable you to make easy and flexible use of the resources here, I
have eliminated most of these elements from this public facing version
of the course. Essentially, what I am providing here is a core dump of
materials I use. The materials are linked throughout the various course
units. Additionally, you can access the raw materials in this
respository’s subdirectories:

-   [/demos](/demos)
-   [/activities](/activities)
-   [/psets](psets)

        resource for learning R because it is the best-designed and most
        effective resource I know of. However, **DataCamp has a
        problematic past**, and I feel an ethical imperative to be
        transparent about this, which is why I am having you read the
        article linked above. If you feel you cannot or should not use
        DataCamp, I encourage you use an alternative option, including
        one of the choices I have listed in the [R
        Resources](#r-resources) section. In case it impacts your
        decision, please know that DataCamp does not gain financially
        from us using it, as instructors at colleges/universities can
        get six free months of DataCamp for their students. In any case,
        you are 100% free to make whatever choice you want and I will
        support you fully!

        it’s valuable to understand how it comes from calculus. Derive
        the Taylor series formula \[hint: start with the Fundamental
        Theorem of Calculus\].
