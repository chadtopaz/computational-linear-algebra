### Problem 1

Convert the following base-10 numbers to binary.

a. 11.25

b. 2/3

c. 99.9

### Problem 1 Solution

a. 11.25 = 11 + 0.25. Integer part: $(11)_{10} = (8 + 2 + 1)_{10} = (1011)_2$. Fractional part: $(0.25)_{10} = (0.01)_2$, so $(11.25)_{10} = (1011.01)_2$.

b. We adopt the strategy of successively multiplying by two and pulling off a bit.
$$\frac{2}{3}*2 = \frac{1}{3} + 1$$
$$\frac{1}{3}*2 = \frac{2}{3} + 0$$
$$\frac{2}{3}*2 = \frac{1}{3} + 1$$
$$\vdots$$
So $(\frac{2}{3})_{10}=(0.\overline{10})_2$

c. $(99.9)_{10} = (99)_{10} + (0.9)_{10}$. For the first part, $(99)_{10} = (64 + 32 + 2 + 1)_{10} = (1100011)_{2}$. For the fractional part, we adopt the strategy of successively multiplying by two and pulling off a bit.

$$0.9*2 = 0.8 + 1$$
$$0.8*2 = 0.6 + 1$$
$$0.6*2 = 0.2 + 1$$
$$0.2*2 = 0.4 + 0$$
$$0.4*2 = 0.8 + 0$$
$$0.8*2 = 0.6 + 1$$
$$\vdots$$
So $(0.9)_{10}=(0.1\overline{1100})_2$, and therefore $(99.9)_{10}=(1100011.1\overline{1100})_{2}$

### Problem 2

a. Explain why you can determine machine epsilon on a computer using IEEE double precision and the IEEE Rounding to Nearest Rule by calculating (7/3 − 4/3) − 1. I'm not asking for (just) a conceptual explanation; you should actually calculate some things on paper to make your argument.

b. Does (4/3 − 1/3) − 1 also give $\epsilon_{mach}$? Explain by converting to floating point numbers and carrying out the machine arithmetic.

### Problem 2 Solution

a. Let's convert the first two terms: $\left(\frac{7}{3}\right)_{10} = 1.00\overline{10}*2^1$, and after rounding, fl$\left(\frac{7}{3}\right) = 1.0010 . . . 1010 1011 * 2^1$; and $\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)_{10} = 1.\overline{01} * 2^0$, and after rounding, fl$\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = 1.01 . . . 0101 0101 * 2^0$. Subtracting the second from the first yields:
$$~~~~1.0010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1011~0*2^1$$
$$-0.1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1010~1*2^1$$
$$-----------------------------------$$
$$=0.1000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~1*2^1$$
$$=1.0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0001*2^0.~~$$
When we subtract 1 from this amount, we are left with $\epsilon_{mach}$.

b. Now $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)_{10} = 1.\overline{01}*2^{-2}$, and after rounding, fl$\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1.01 . . . 0101 0101 * 2^{−2}$. Subtracting this from $\frac{4}{3}$, we have:
$$~~1.0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~00*2^0$$
$$-0.0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~0101~01*2^0$$
$$-----------------------------------$$
$$=0.1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~11*2^0$$
$$=1.1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1111~1*2^{-1},~~$$
which rounds to $10*2^{-1}=1.0*2^0$. Subtracting 1 yields 0, not $\epsilon_{mach}.$

Let's test it out:
```{r}
options(digits=20)
.Machine$double.eps
(7/3-4/3)-1
(4/3-1/3)-1
```

### Problem 3

Using R, compute:  1000000000000000000 + 100 - 1000000000000000000. What happens?  Show some hand calculations to explain the result.

### Problem 3 Solution

```{r}
1000000000000000000 + 100 - 1000000000000000000
```

In binary, 1000000000000000000 is equal to (use an online converter)

$$1101~1110~0000~1011~0110~1011~0011~1010~0111~0110~0100~0000~0000~0000~0000=1.10111100000101101101011001110100111011001000000000000000000*2^{59}$$

When we convert to double precision, we only keep 52 bits after the decimal and the last 7 get rounded, but since they are all zeros, we can exactly represent  1000000000000000000 as 

$$1.1011110000010110110101100111010011101100100000000000*2^{59}$$

Meanwhile, in binary, 1000000000000000100 is equal to

$$1101~1110~0000~1011~0110~1011~0011~1010~0111~0110~0100~0000~0000~0110~0100=1.10111100000101101101011001110100111011001000000000001100100 * 2^{59}$$

When we convert this to double precision, the last seven digits (1100100) get chopped off, and the 0 in the 8th to last position gets rounded up to 1, so we have

$$1.1011110000010110110101100111010011101100100000000001 * 2^{59}$$

Now the difference between 1000000000000000100 and 1000000000000000000 is 
$$
0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 * 2^{59} = (10000000)_2 = (128)_{10}
$$

This is another example of cancellation error, which occurs because the function evaluation of $x_1-x_2$ is bad when $x_1$ and $x_2$ are relatively close.

### Problem 4
Find the smallest positive integer $i$ such that $i$ is not exactly representable using the IEEE standard in double precision; i.e., $\hbox{fl}(i)\neq i$.

### Problem 4 Solution

Everything that has 52 bits in the mantissa can be represented exactly, so we need 1.0*2^53 at least, and then we need to put a 1 in the 53 bit of the mantissa so that some rounding will occur:
$$1.0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~0000~1 * 2^{53}, $$
which is equal to 9007199254740993. This gets rounded down to 9007199254740992 (recall that the rounding rule when the next digit is 1 followed by all zeros is to round so that the new final digit is 0, which in this case is rounding down). You can try this out!

```{r options}
print(9007199254740993,digits=16)
```
