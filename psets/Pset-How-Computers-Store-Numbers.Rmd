### Problem 1

Convert the following base-10 numbers to binary.

a\. 11.25

b\. 2/3

c\. 99.9

### Problem 1 Solution

a\. Your solution goes here.

b\. Your solution goes here.

c\. Your solution goes here.

### Problem 2

a\. Explain why you can determine machine epsilon on a computer using IEEE double precision and the IEEE Rounding to Nearest Rule by calculating (7/3 − 4/3) − 1. I'm not asking for (just) a conceptual explanation; you should actually calculate some things on paper to make your argument.

b\. Does (4/3 − 1/3) − 1 also give $\epsilon_{mach}$? Explain by converting to floating point numbers and carrying out the machine arithmetic.

### Problem 2 Solution

a\. Your solution goes here.

b\. Your solution goes here.

### Problem 3

Using R, compute:  1000000000000000000 + 100 - 1000000000000000000. What happens?  Show some hand calculations to explain the result.

### Problem 3 Solution

### Problem 4

Find the smallest positive integer $i$ such that $i$ is not exactly representable using the IEEE standard in double precision; i.e., $fl(i)\neq i$.
