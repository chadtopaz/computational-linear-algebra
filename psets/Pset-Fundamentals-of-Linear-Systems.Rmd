### Problem 1

A real $n \times n$ matrix $\mat{Q}$ is *orthonormal* if 

$$
\mat{Q}^{T}\,\mat{Q}=\mat{Q}\,\mat{Q}^T=\mat{I};~i.e., \mat{Q}^{-1}=\mat{Q}^T.
$$

Note: sometimes you will see these matrices just called *orthogonal matrices*. 

Show that $||\mat{Q}||_2=||\mat{Q}^{-1}||_2=1$, and therefore the 2-norm condition number of any orthonormal matrix $\mat{Q}$ is $\kappa_2(\mat{Q})=||\mat{Q}||_2 ||\mat{Q}^{-1}||_2=1$.

### Problem 2

Consider the $n \times n$ square matrix

$$
A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & \ldots & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 & \ldots & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & \ldots & -1 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

a\. Write a function that takes a value of $n$ as input and outputs the matrix A above. Challenge yourself to be efficient in your coding when you create the matrix. Looking at patterns and Googling how to create them helps. I managed to create the matrix with no loops, in two lines of code. Hint: the commands `upper.tri` and `diag` will be helpful.

b\. Use your function and the R command `kappa` to calculate the approximate condition number $\kappa(\mat{A})$ for $n=1,\ldots,30$. Plot $\log_{10}[\kappa(\mat{A})]$ as a function of $n$ and use the commands `lm` and `abline` to plot a best fit line. How would you describe the conditioning of the matrix as $n$ increases?

c\. Now choose $n=30$. Generate the matrix $\mat{A}$ and let $\vec{b_1}$ be an $n \times 1$ vector of random numbers chosen uniformly from 0 to 1. Solve $\mat{A}\,\vec{x}_1 = \vec{b}_1$ using any appropriate method that you want (including R's built-in capabilities). Now let $\vec{b}_2 = \vec{b}_1 + (0,\ldots,0,0.001)^T$, that is, you leave the first 29 elements the same as in $\vec{b}_1$ but add 0.001 to the last element. Solve $\mat{A}\,\vec{x}_2 = \vec{b}_2$. Use the command `Norm` to find the (approximate) 2-norm of $\vec{x_1}-\vec{x_2}$ and discuss vis-a-vis your result from part b. Also, to help build your intuition, find the magnitude of the difference between the first coordinate of $\vec{x}_1$ and that of $\vec{x}_2$.

An important concern in the study of heat transfer is to determine the steady-state temperature distribution of a thin plate when the temperature around the boundary is known. Assume the plate shown in the figure above represents a cross section of a metal beam, with negligible heat flow in the direction perpendicular to the plate. Let the variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_8$ denote the temperatures at nodes 1 through 8 in the picture. In steady state, the temperature at a node is approximately equal to the average of the four nearest nodes (to the left, above, right, below).

a\. The solution to the approximate steady-state heat flow problem for this plate can be written as a system of linear equations $\mat{A}\,\vec{x}=\vec{b}$, where $x=[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_8]$ is the vector of temperatures at nodes 1 through 8. Find the $8 \times 8$ matrix $A$ and the vector $b$.

b\. Solve the system any way you want (using R) to find the unknown temperatures.

### Problem 4

This is a problem about network science. Networks are objects made up of **vertices** (visualized as dots) that are connected by **edges** (visualized as straight or curved lines, doesn't matter which). A network is said to be **undirected** if the edges have no direction to them (no arrows), and **directed** if the directionality of the edges matters (arrows present). As a matter of vocabulary, sometimes people interchangeably use the word "graph" for network and "vertex" for node.

The following command loads a matrix $\mat{A}$ describing the western power network of the United States. This is an undirected network. Each element is zero or one. A one in row $i$ and column $j$ means that component $i$ of the network is connected by an edge to component $j$. This type of matrix is called a network's **adjacency matrix**.

```{r cache = TRUE}
A <- readMM(gzcon(url("https://math.nist.gov/pub/MatrixMarket2/Harwell-Boeing/bcspwr/bcspwr10.mtx.gz"))) + 0
```

Above, the `readMM` and `gzcon` commands read the data. We add zero (which seems strange!) for the following reason. R initially interprets the matrix, which only contains ones and zeroes, as representing `TRUE` and `FALSE` logical values, which is not what we want. However, once you perform arithmetic on logical values, they get turned into their numerical values.

It's worth realizing that the adjacency matrix and a picture of the network are just two ways of representing the same thing; if you know one, you know the other. Let's visualize the network using a package called `igraph`. It may take a little bit of time to run the commands below because the network is large. Note how we set the color and size of the nodes. Here, `V` means "vertices". In other words, we are accessing the vertices `V` of the network `g`, creating properties called `color` and `size` that will be used for plotting, and assigning all nodes the color grey and the size 2.

```{r cache = TRUE, out.width = '70%'}
g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, mode="undirected")
V(g)$color <- "grey"
V(g)$size <- 2
myLayout <- layout_nicely(g)
plot(simplify(g), layout=myLayout, vertex.color=V(g)$color, vertex.size=V(g)$size, vertex.label="")
```

a\. In the analysis of networks, one is often concerned with finding the most important (most central, in some sense) component. One measure of importance is called Katz centrality. The Katz centrality of the nodes, $\vec{x}$, satisfies

$$
\vec{x} = \bigl((\mat{I} - \alpha \mat{A}^T)^{-1} - \mat{I} \bigr) \vec{1}
$$

where $\mat{I}$ is the identity matrix, $\vec{1}$ is a vector of ones, and $\alpha$ is a parameter that we get to choose. You can just take this definition as a given. The mathematical ideas behind the definition of Katz centrality are perhaps best suited for a course focusing specifically on network science but if you are interested, go investigate the topic on your own or ask me to point you to some sources.

Write the system in the form $\mat{M}\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. Then take $\alpha = 0.05$ and solve for $\vec{x}$ using R's `solve` command. Your solution vector $\vec{x}$ will come out as a sparse matrix type but just go ahead and convert it to a "regular" vector by using `x <- as.numeric(x)`. Print out the largest element of $\vec{x}$ using the `max` command so that I can verify your answer. Make a histogram of all the Katz centralities.

b\. Re-plot the network using your same network layout as before, color the most important node red and plot it with size 5. This way, the most important node (at least, according to the Katz measure) will stand out on your plot. Remember, you can set colors of nodes by assigning values to the `colors` field of the vertices `V` of the network `g`. That is to say, if I wanted to set the 10th node to be green, I could write `V(g)$color[10] <- "green"`. Similarly, we can set sizes with commands like `V(g)$size[10] <- 17`. Finally, we of course don't want the 10th node; we want whichever node turns out to have the largest Katz centrality. Here, you can use the command `which.max` to find its index. For example, if I wanted to know the index of the largest value of the vector $(1,3,5,7,6,4,2)$, I could do

```{r}
v <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2)
which.max(v)
```
